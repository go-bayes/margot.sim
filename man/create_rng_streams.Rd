\title{RNG Stream Management for Parallel Monte Carlo}
\usage{
create_rng_streams(n_streams, seed = NULL, kind = "L'Ecuyer-CMRG")
}
\arguments{
\item{n_streams}{Number of independent RNG streams needed}

\item{seed}{Master seed for reproducibility}

\item{kind}{RNG kind (default: "L'Ecuyer-CMRG" for parallel safety)}
}
\value{
List of RNG stream states
}
\description{
Implements proper random number generation stream management for
reproducible parallel Monte Carlo simulations.
}
\details{
This module ensures that:
- Each Monte Carlo replication gets its own independent RNG stream
- Results are reproducible regardless of parallelisation
- Streams don't overlap between replications
- The same results are obtained whether run in parallel or sequential
Create RNG streams for parallel processing
}
\examples{
# Create 100 independent streams
streams <- create_rng_streams(100, seed = 123)
}
