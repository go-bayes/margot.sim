\title{Create interaction shift interventions}
\usage{
create_interaction_shift(treatments, start_wave = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{treatments}{Named list mapping treatment names to their shift configs.
Each config should have 'shift_to' (target value) and optionally
'condition' (function to determine if shift applies).}

\item{start_wave}{Wave at which to start shifting (default: 1)}
}
\value{
Function suitable for multi-treatment interventions
}
\description{
Creates shift functions for multi-treatment interactions where each
treatment can be shifted independently or in combination.
}
\examples{
# Shift two treatments to create interaction
interaction_shift <- create_interaction_shift(
  treatments = list(
    "treatment_a" = list(shift_to = 1),
    "treatment_b" = list(shift_to = 1)
  )
)

# Conditional interaction - only shift B if A is high
conditional_shift <- create_interaction_shift(
  treatments = list(
    "treatment_a" = list(shift_to = 1),
    "treatment_b" = list(
      shift_to = 1,
      condition = function(data) data[["treatment_a"]] > 0.5
    )
  )
)
}
