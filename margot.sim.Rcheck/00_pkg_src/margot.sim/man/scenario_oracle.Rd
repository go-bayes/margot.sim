\description{
This file contains simple pre-built scenarios that work with 
standard margot_simulate() output without requiring specific variable names.

This file contains pre-built scenarios representing common research
contexts with typical observational challenges.
Create oracle scenario

The oracle scenario represents perfect measurement with no observational
distortions. This serves as a theoretical benchmark against which other
scenarios can be compared.
