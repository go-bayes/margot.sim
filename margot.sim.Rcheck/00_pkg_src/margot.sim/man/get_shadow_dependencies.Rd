get_shadow_dependencies()
}
\value{
List of dependency definitions
}
\description{
Implements a dependency system for shadows to handle interactions
between different types of observational distortions. For example,
truncation changes the variance which affects measurement error.

Returns the dependency relationships between shadow types.
Each shadow type can declare which aspects of the data it modifies
and which aspects it depends on.
}
\details{
The system uses a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to represent dependencies
and automatically reorders shadows for correct application sequence.
