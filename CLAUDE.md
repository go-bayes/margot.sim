# margot.sim Package Context

## Overview
margot.sim is an R package for simulating longitudinal data with realistic observational challenges and evaluating causal inference methods through Monte Carlo simulation. It implements a "shadowing" framework inspired by Plato's Allegory of the Cave, where observed data are distorted versions ("shadows") of true causal processes.
